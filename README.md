# Clark Hall Pub Loyalty Application

iOS based loyalty rewards application created for Clark Hall Pub (located on Queen's University Campus) as part of APSC 100 Engineering Practice course.
Application is a prototype to show the possibility of using an iphone application to reward loyal patrons.
The application was developed in XCode using Swift and uses Twitter Dev kit for the pub's twitter integration.

## The Concept
The patron would use the application along with a NFC enabled iphone to tap a NFC tag inside Clark Hall Pub upon each entry. Each NFC "tap" would register as one visit and earn the user points. Once a set number of points are earned, the user can request a reward of varying point's value from the establishments staff. The staff would use a administrative login to deduct the redeemed points from the user's application.
It was proposed that phones without NFC capability could make use of a daily QR code posted in the pub.

Due to time and hardware constraints the final design was never fully implemented in the iOS application.
The design is fully documented in report "Phase 4-Team 399A.docx" under the Documentation directory.
